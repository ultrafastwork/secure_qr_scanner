## 💡 Tips for New Agents

1. **Read First**: `ai-docs/progress-handoffs/progress-handoff-v0.1.0-complete.md` for implementation patterns
2. **Follow Structure**: Use feature-based directories (`qr_code/`, `history/`, `barcode/`)
3. **State Management**: We use Riverpod (see history feature for examples)
4. **Design Consistency**: Match existing glassmorphism style (see `ai-docs/DESIGN.md`)
5. **Code Quality**: Run `flutter analyze` - should show 0 issues
